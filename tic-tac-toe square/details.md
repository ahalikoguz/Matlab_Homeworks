Dear Students, 

In this homework you are responsible to develop a bayesian classifier. Note that, any programming languages are welcome but matlab, java and c# will be preferred. I attached two sets, training and test sets accordingly. Your classifer algorithm should solve the test samples by using the training set provided. Please be assured that you only the author of your codes and downloading the source from the internet is strongly discouraged. Once you finished your program verify and validate your software by submitting mini train set with your calculation conducted manually. 2 weeks later in the lecture hour i will check your codes and contributions and ask you some questions regarding to the originality of your own works. Simple copy-paste and downloading from the internet will be penalized. 

Some information about the problem is as follows;
%Relevant Information:
%
%  This database encodes the complete set of possible board configurations
%   at the end of tic-tac-toe games, where "x" is assumed to have played
%   first.  The target concept is "win for x" (i.e., true when "x" has one
%  of 8 possible ways to create a "three-in-a-row").  
%
%   Interestingly, this raw database gives a stripped-down decision tree
%   algorithm (e.g., ID3) fits.  However, the rule-based CN2 algorithm, the
%   simple IB1 instance-based learning algorithm, and the CITRE 
%   feature-constructing decision tree algorithm perform well on it.
%
%Number of Instances: 958 (legal tic-tac-toe endgame boards)
%
%Number of Attributes: 9, each corresponding to one tic-tac-toe square
%
%Attribute Information: (x=player x has taken, o=player o has taken, b=blank)
%
%    1. top-left-square: {x,o,b}
%    2. top-middle-square: {x,o,b}
%    3. top-right-square: {x,o,b}
%    4. middle-left-square: {x,o,b}
%    5. middle-middle-square: {x,o,b}
%    6. middle-right-square: {x,o,b}
%    7. bottom-left-square: {x,o,b}
%    8. bottom-middle-square: {x,o,b}
%    9. bottom-right-square: {x,o,b}
%   10. Class: {positive,negative}

Best Wishes
